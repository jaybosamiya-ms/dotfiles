  #
  ##### Previous config
  # # Forward over a connection via g2001
  # #   -q: quiet, -a: disable forwarding auth agent, -x: disable X11
  # #   These 3 options only apply to the connection to g2001, and not to cg2001

  # # The forwarding connects into the lxc container, and then with low
  # # privileges (nobody), pushes port 22 over. This is what the main
  # # connection connects into, and the authentication and xforwarding
  # # and such happens.
